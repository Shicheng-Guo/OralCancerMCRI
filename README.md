 #### Introduction

In the MCRI scientist meeting on 10/02/2019, I gave a talk about "". 


Project Update:

* 2019/10/25, 2nd meeting with Steve, Ingrid and Neel. We fixed the main research aim in this meeting and find UW-collaborator:[Dr. Randy Kimple](https://www.humonc.wisc.edu/team_member/randall-kimple/). Obviously, Dr. Kimple prefer to do oral cavity cancer in this project.
